/*
 * This is a fairly big mixin.
 * The reason for this is that at the time of writing (09/01/2013),
 * Sass does not include functions for substring or find/replace in string.
 * Chris Eppstein sent a Pull Request to Sass with the str-extract (substring) function back in June,
 * but it still has not been merged, due to lack of minor comments.
 * That was five months ago.
